                            Payment fraud is one of the most common types of e-commerce fraud. Criminals use stolen credit card information, fake payment methods, or chargeback fraud to steal funds from businesses or consumers. Chargebacks occur when a customer disputes a transaction, and the merchant is forced to return the payment, often without proof of fraud.
