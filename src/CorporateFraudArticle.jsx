              Why Does Corporate Fraud Happen?
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: '#555', mt: 1 }}>
              Corporate fraud can occur for several reasons, often involving a combination of
              pressure, greed, and lack of oversight. Some of the major causes include:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure to Meet Targets:</strong> Companies may resort to fraudulent
                    practices to meet financial goals or stock market expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Internal Controls:</strong> Ineffective audits and a lack of proper
                    checks and balances can allow fraud to go unnoticed.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate Culture:</strong> A corporate culture that encourages unethical
                    behavior may foster fraudulent activities.</li>
              </ul>
