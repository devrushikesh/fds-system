                Phishing attacks are a form of cybercrime where attackers attempt to trick individuals into providing sensitive personal information, such as login credentials, financial details, or social security numbers. Phishing scams often appear to come from legitimate sources, such as banks, email providers, or even trusted colleagues, but they are designed to deceive and exploit unsuspecting victims. In this article, we'll dive into the nature of phishing attacks, how to identify them, and how you can protect yourself from becoming a victim.

                What Are Phishing Attacks?
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                Phishing attacks typically involve attackers impersonating legitimate entities to obtain sensitive data from individuals. The attacker often uses email, text messages, phone calls, or fake websites to lure victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments. Once the victim interacts with the phishing attempt, the attacker can collect login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal data.

                                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The attacker gathers information about the victim, often from social media, public records, or other sources.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deceptive Communication:</strong> The attacker sends a message (email, SMS, phone call, etc.) impersonating a trusted entity like a bank, government agency, or well-known company.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trick the Victim:</strong> The message contains a link to a fake website or prompts the victim to enter sensitive information, such as their account details, passwords, or payment methods.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Harvesting:</strong> Once the victim provides the information, the attacker collects the data for malicious purposes, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or selling it on the dark web.</li>

                            Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to legitimate sources but may have slight variations. For example, an email claiming to be from your bank might come from "support@bankname.com" instead of the actual "support@banknameofficial.com."

                            Phishing attempts often use urgent language to make you act quickly, such as "Immediate Action Required" or "Your Account is Suspended!" This tactic pressures you into making quick decisions without considering the potential risks.
