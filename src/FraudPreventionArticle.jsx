                            Online shopping fraud often involves fake e-commerce sites or deceptive sellers who collect payments for non-existent items. These scams can be avoided by checking for secure websites (HTTPS), reading reviews, and avoiding suspiciously low prices. Fraudulent sellers may create legitimate-looking sites or mimic known brands, tricking buyers into providing payment information.

                            Phishing scams involve fraudsters posing as reputable institutions (like banks or government agencies) to trick you into revealing personal information. These often come in the form of emails or text messages, containing urgent messages or links that lead to fake login pages. Never click on suspicious links, and always verify the sender’s authenticity.
